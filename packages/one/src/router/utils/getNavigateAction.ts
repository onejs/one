     * (by moving the screen to the top of the stack)
     * When you try and push to a screen with the same ID, no navigation will occur

     *
     * One needs to retain the default behavior of PUSH, consistently adding new screens to the stack, even if their IDs are identical.
     *
     * To resolve this issue, we switch to using a NAVIGATE action with a new key. In the navigate action, screens are matched by either key or getId() function.
     * By generating a unique new key, we ensure that the screen is always pushed onto the stack.
