# `./packages` Directory

The `./packages` folder contains packages we publish to npm.

## Common Practices

* Most packages needs to be built. Run `yarn build` under a package directory to build the package.
* Be sure to build the package after making changes to the source code so you can see your updates in other apps. You may also need to restart the development server for the changes to take effect.
