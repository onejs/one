/**
 * The `sst.config.ts` file is used to configure your SST app and its resources.
 *
 * ```ts
 * $config(input: Config): Config
 * ```
 *
 * You specify it using the `$config` function. This takes an object of type [`Config`](#config).
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
 * /// <reference path="./.sst/platform/config.d.ts" />
 *
 * export default $config({
 *   // Your app's config
 *   app(input) {
 *     return {
 *       name: "my-sst-app",
 *       home: "aws"
 *     };
 *   },
 *   // Your app's resources
 *   async run() {
 *     const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket");
 *
 *     // Your app's outputs
 *     return {
 *       bucket: bucket.name
 *     };
 *   },
 *   // Optionally, your app's Console config
 *   console: {
 *     autodeploy: {
 *       runner: { compute: "large" }
 *     }
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * The `Config` object takes:
 * 1. [`app`](#app-2) — Your config
 * 2. [`run`](#run) — Your resources
 * 3. [`console`](#console) — Optionally, your app's Console config
 *
 * The `app` function is evaluated right when your app loads. It's used to define the app config and its providers.
 *
 * :::note
 * You need TypeScript 5 to see the types in your config.
 * :::
 *
 * You can add Pulumi code in the `run` function not the `app` function. While the `run`
 * function is where you define your resources using SST or Pulumi's components.
 *
 * The run function also has access to a list of [Global](/docs/reference/global/) `$` variables and functions. These serve as the context for your app config.
 *
 * :::caution
 * Do not `import` the provider packages in your `sst.config.ts`.
 * :::
 *
 * Since SST manages importing your provider packages, it's recommended not to add any imports
 * in your `sst.config.ts`.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * #### .env
 *
 * Your `.env` and `.env.<stage>` files are loaded as environment variables in your config.
 * They need to be in the same directory as your `sst.config.ts`.
 *
 * ```bash title=".env"
 * MY_ENV_VAR=hello
 * ```
 *
 * And are available as `process.env` in both your `app` and `run` functions.
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
 * process.env.MY_ENV_VAR
 * ```
 *
 * The `.env` file takes precedence over `.env.<stage>`. So if you have a `.env` and a
 * `.env.dev` file, the values in the `.env` file will be used.
 *
 * :::note
 * You need to restart `sst dev` for changes in your `.env` files to take effect.
 * :::
 *
 * Make sure the stage name in your `.env.<stage>` matches the stage your app is running on.

     * Now when you _git push_ to a branch, pull request, or tag, the following happens:
     *
     * 1. The stage name is generated based on the `autodeploy.target` callback.
     *    1. If there is no callback, the stage name is a sanitized version of the branch or tag.
     *    2. If there is a callback but no stage is returned, the deploy is skipped.
     * 2. The runner config is generated based on the `autodeploy.runner`. Or the defaults are
     *    used.
     * 3. The stage is matched against the environments in the Console to get the AWS account
     *    and any environment variables for the deploy.
     * 4. The deploy is run based on the above config.
     *
     * This only applies only to git events. If you trigger a deploy through the Console, you
     * are asked to sepcify the stage you want to deploy to. So in this case, it skips step 1
     * from above and does not call `autodeploy.target`.
     *
     * Both `target` and `runner` are optional and come with defaults, so you don't need to
     * configure anything. But you can customize them.
     *
     * ```ts title="sst.config.ts" {"target", "runner"}
     * console: {
     *   autodeploy: {
     *     target(event) {
     *       if (
     *         event.type === "branch" &&
     *         event.branch === "main" &&
     *         event.action === "pushed"
     *        ) {
     *         return { stage: "production" };
     *       }
     *     },
     *     runner(stage) {
     *       if (stage === "production") return { timeout: "3 hours" };
     *     }
     *   }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * For example, here we are only auto-deploying to the `production` stage when you git push
     * to the `main` branch. We are also setting the timeout to 3 hours for the `production`
     * stage.
     *
     * @default Auto-deploys branches and PRs.

       * Return `undefined` to skip the deploy.
       * :::
       *
       * The stage that is returned is then compared to the environments set in the
       * [app settings in the Console](/docs/console/#setup). If the stage matches an
       * environment, the stage will be deployed to that environment. If no matching environment
       * is found, the deploy will be skipped.
       *
       * :::note
       * You need to configure an environment in the Console to be able to deploy to it.
       * :::
       *
       * Currently, only git events for **branches**, **pull requests**, and **tags** are
       * supported.
       *
       * :::tip
       * This is not called when you manually trigger a deploy through the Console.
       * :::
       *
       * This config only applies to git events. If you trigger a deploy through the Console,
       * you are asked to sepcify the stage you want to deploy to. In this case, and
       * when you redeploy a manual deploy, the `target` function is not called.
       *
       * By default, this is what the `target` function looks like:
       *
       * ```ts
       * {
       *   target(event) {
       *     if (event.type === "branch" && event.action === "pushed") {
       *       return {
       *         stage: event.branch
       *           .replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9-]/g, "-")
       *           .replace(/-+/g, "-")
       *           .replace(/^-/g, "")
       *           .replace(/-$/g, "")
       *       };
       *     }
       *
       *     if (event.type === "pull_request") {
       *       return { stage: `pr-${event.number}` };
       *     }
       *   }
       * }
       * ```
       *
       * So for a:
       *
       * - **branch**: The stage name is a sanitized version of the branch name. When a branch
       *   is removed, the stage is **not removed**.
       * - **pull request**: The stage name is `pr-<number>`. When a pull request is closed,
       *   the stage **is removed**.
       *

       * Git events to tags are not auto-deployed by default. You can change this by adding it
       * to your config.
       *
       * ```ts
       * {
       *   target(event) {
       *     if (event.type === "tag" && event.action === "pushed") {
       *       return {
       *         stage: "tag-" + event.tag
       *           .replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9-]/g, "-")

       * Here, similar to the branch event, we are sanitizing the tag name to generate the stage.
       * Just make sure to configure the environment for these tag stages in the Console.

       * If you don't want to auto-deploy for a given event, you can return `undefined`. For
       * example, to skip any deploys to the `staging` stage.
