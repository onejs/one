title: one dev
---

Developing an app with One is as simple as `one dev`.

It takes the following arguments:

```bash
--clean    # boolean, will clear all caches before running
--host     # string, set the hostname to bind to
--port     # string, set the port to bind to
--debug    # turns on vite debugging
```

The One development server serves both web and native apps on the same port at the same time, and should hot reload both at once. When you see the `Server running on` message with a host and port, that is the same for both native and web.

## Native Development

The `one dev` command only starts the development server — it does not build or run the native iOS/Android shell. For native development you have two options:

### Using Expo Go

For quick development without custom native dependencies, install [Expo Go](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779) on your device. It will auto-detect from your simulator, or press <kbd>q</kbd>, <kbd>r</kbd> in the terminal to open the app.

### Building the Native Shell

If you need custom native dependencies, you'll need to build the native shell first:

1. Run `one prebuild` to generate the native Xcode/Android project
2. Run `one run:ios` or `one run:android` to build and launch the app

**Tip:** Add `--dev` to automatically start the Vite dev server: `one run:ios --dev`

See the [Build or Run the Native iOS App](/docs/guides-ios-native) guide for detailed instructions.

## Metro Mode

By default, One uses Vite as the native bundler. For production apps, you may want to use [Metro mode](/docs/metro-mode) which provides better stability and compatibility with React Native packages.
