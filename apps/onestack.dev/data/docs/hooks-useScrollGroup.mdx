title: useScrollGroup
---

Register the current route as a scroll group. Child routes will preserve scroll position when navigating between them.

This is useful for layouts where you want to maintain scroll position while users navigate between child routes, such as:
- Tab layouts where switching tabs shouldn't reset the parent scroll
- Dashboard layouts with multiple sections
- Any nested layout that wants independent scroll restoration

## Usage

Use this hook in a layout component to create a scroll group for all its children:

```tsx
// app/dashboard/_layout.tsx
import { useScrollGroup, Slot } from 'one'

export default function DashboardLayout() {
  // All routes under /dashboard will share scroll position
  useScrollGroup()

  return (
    <div>
      <nav>Dashboard Navigation</nav>
      <Slot />
    </div>
  )
}
```

When users navigate between `/dashboard/overview`, `/dashboard/settings`, and `/dashboard/reports`, the scroll position of the dashboard layout will be preserved.

## Custom Group Path

By default, `useScrollGroup` uses the current pathname. You can specify a custom group path:

```tsx
// Create a scroll group for a specific path prefix
useScrollGroup('/products')
```

## Programmatic Scroll Groups

You can also specify a scroll group when navigating programmatically:

```tsx
import { useRouter } from 'one'

function MyComponent() {
  const router = useRouter()

  const goToSettings = () => {
    router.navigate('/dashboard/settings', {
      scrollGroup: '/dashboard'
    })
  }

  return <button onClick={goToSettings}>Go to Settings</button>
}
```

## How It Works

1. When a layout calls `useScrollGroup()`, it registers the current path as a scroll group
2. When navigating, if both the previous and new routes are within the same scroll group, the scroll position is preserved
3. If navigating to a route outside the scroll group, scroll resets to the top

## Platform Support

This hook only affects web scroll behavior. On native platforms, it's a no-op since React Navigation handles scroll restoration differently.

## Type

```tsx
function useScrollGroup(groupPath?: string): void
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `groupPath` | `string` (optional) | Custom path to use as the scroll group. Defaults to current pathname. |
