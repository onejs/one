### Why Vite?

It feels light and simple, runs fast and is easy to customize. It tree shakes well, has tons of web features, and has best-in-class types, documentation, type-docs, RFCs and community. It also has a huge ecosystem and responsive team.

### Is this production ready?

Yes! Thanks to many web bug fixes, tests and improvements, and native landing [metro mode](/docs/native-metro-mode), One is now generally production ready.

See the [Status documentation](/docs/status) for more details.

### Is this on Metro? Is it Expo Router?

No, One started as a fork of [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) to test and improve [vxrn](https://vxrn.dev). To test that we ported [tamagui.dev](https://tamagui.dev) to it and enjoyed it.

To make that port work well we added [render modes](/docs/routing-modes), [loaders](/docs/routing-loader), [middlewares](/docs/routing-middlewares), a lot of configuration to make a large amount of node_modules work, a CLI, a production Hono server, and some other [smaller features](/docs/features).

### Will you support RSC?

In the best case scenario, we'd like to build our apps as though they were completely client-side, and have smart tools and libraries make them work fast. Mostly-client-side apps are great, and RSC adds a lot of new concepts to learn.

Further, once you have a great client-side data solution like Zero, you don't want to be going back to the server often, as it would degrade user experience.

Finally, we do have [server rendering](/docs/routing-modes) and [loaders](/docs/routing-loader) that are both very simple, we save a lot of effort and complexity without server components.

We'd like to explore bringing a simplified subset of RSC to One in the future.

### What's the npm package?

It's `one`, thanks to Dan Maier.
