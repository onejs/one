title: Dev Tools
---

One includes a unified development tools panel to help you debug and optimize your app. Open it with **Alt+Space** (Option+Space on Mac) to see a spotlight-style picker.

## Opening Dev Tools

Press **Alt+Space** to open the spotlight menu, then select a tool. You can also use keyboard shortcuts to jump directly to a specific panel:

- **Alt+S** - SEO Preview
- **Alt+R** - Route Info
- **Alt+L** - Loader Timing
- **Alt+E** - Errors

Press **Escape** to close any panel.

## SEO Preview

See how your page appears in Google search results and check for common SEO issues:

- **Google Preview** - Live preview of your search result appearance
- **Meta Tags** - View title, description, and Open Graph tags
- **Issues** - Warnings for missing or too-long meta tags

## Route Info

Debug the current route state:

- **Pathname** - The current URL path
- **Segments** - Path broken into segments
- **Route Params** - Dynamic params from the route (e.g., `[id]`)
- **Search Params** - Query string values

## Loader Timing

Visualize loader performance with a waterfall breakdown:

- **Module Load Time** - Time to import the loader module
- **Execution Time** - Time to run the loader function
- **Total Time** - Combined timing with visual bar

Useful for identifying slow loaders and optimizing data fetching.

## Errors

Track errors from error boundaries and loaders:

- **Error Type** - Whether from a boundary or loader
- **Timestamp** - When the error occurred
- **Message** - The error message

Errors are collected in real-time so you can see issues as they happen.

## Source Inspector

Hold **Shift+Cmd** (Mac) or **Shift+Ctrl** (Windows/Linux) and hover over any element to see its source location. Click to open the file in your editor.

This requires the `data-one-source` attribute which One adds automatically to components during development.

## Panel Features

The dev tools panel is:

- **Draggable** - Drag the header to reposition
- **Edge Snapping** - Snaps to screen edges with 10px padding
- **Resizable** - Tracks window resize when snapped to edges

## Configuration

Dev tools are enabled by default in development mode. To disable them, set:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { one } from 'one/vite'

export default {
  plugins: [
    one({
      devtools: false
    })
  ]
}
```
