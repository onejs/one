Getting started with One is as as easy as:

```bash
npx one
```

The CLI will guide you through the process of bootstrapping one of our starter templates.

If this is your first One app, we recommend taking this route, as you can choose between bare-bones example all the way up to a full stack with a user system and authentication. We will be launching more starters as the project matures.

### 5-minute tutorial

While we recommend using a preset to get started, it's helpful to walk through creating a new One app from scratch.

For those of you who prefer to learn by doing, we've put together a 5-minute tutorial that will have you building a basic app in no time.

Let's begin with our package.json:

```json fileName=package.json
{
  "name": "one-app",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "one dev",
    "build": "one build",
    "serve": "one serve"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "one": "latest",
    "react": "~19.0.0",
    "react-native": "~0.79.2",
    "react-native-web": "^0.19.12"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "vite": "^6"
  }
}
```

It is strongly recommended to pin the `one` version for production stability:

```bash
npm install one@latest --save-exact
```

This ensures consistent behavior across different environments and deployments.

If using pnpm or a package manager that symlinks dependencies, you'll want to disable that setting.
One has (just a few) patches that fix dependencies. In part this is to enable switching between React 19 on web and React 18 on native, in part this is because the React Native ecosystem has many, many weirdly published packages - think JSX or Flowtype published in `.js` files, or non-standard legacy babel experimental transforms, etc. We are working with package authors to improve this, but we've found patches to be both simpler and require less mysterious behavior/slowdowns than the alternative of making Vite handle everything internally.

### Vite Config

Next, let's add our ultra-simple `vite.config.ts`:

```tsx fileName=vite.config.ts
// Typed as UserConfig for handy autocomplete
import type { UserConfig } from 'vite'
import { one } from 'one/vite'

export default {
  plugins: [
    one(),
  ],
} satisfies UserConfig
```

### TSConfig

One will create a TSConfig for you when you first start the dev server, with some defaults that work well. Of course you can create your own if you'd prefer. The default looks like this:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "~/*": [
        "./*"
      ]
    },
    "strict": true,
    "rootDir": ".",
    "module": "Preserve",
    "moduleResolution": "Bundler",
    "preserveSymlinks": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "noImplicitAny": false,
    "types": [
      "node",
      "react",
      "vite/client"
    ],
    "lib": [
      "dom",
      "esnext"
    ]
  },
  "exclude": [
    "node_modules",
    ".expo",
    "**/test",
    "**/dist",
    "**/types",
    "**/__tests__"
  ]
}
```

### File System Routes

One expects your file system routes to be placed in an `app` directory.

`app/_layout.tsx` serves as the top-level wrapper for all routes, ideal for:

1. Consistent page structure
2. Global styles or themes
3. Persistent navigation
4. App-wide state management

One uses the `<Slot />` component to indicate where child components should render, allowing for nested layouts and fine-grained control over your UI structure.

Let's create a root layout `app/_layout.tsx`:

```tsx fileName=app/_layout.tsx
import { Slot } from 'one'

export default function Layout() {
  return <Slot />
}
```

And then create a simple index page `app/index.tsx`:

```tsx fileName=app/index.tsx
import { View, Text } from "react-native";

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <View
      style={{
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: "center",
        alignItems: "center",
        minHeight: "100%",
      }}
    >
      <Text>Hello from One</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

You can now install your node modules and run your app. ðŸŽ‰

```bash
yarn install && yarn dev
```

### Running your app

If the port isn't taken, you should be able to load [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) and to see your website (use `--port` to change the port).

On native, you can use an [Expo Go](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779) development app and load your app with [exp://0.0.0.0:8081](exp://0.0.0.0.:8081). Press the key combination <kbd>q</kbd>, <kbd>r</kbd> in your terminal which is running the dev server, and scan the QR code with your iPhone's camera if your computer and iPhone are connected to the same WiFi network.

Note that for web-only projects you don't need `react-native`, and further note that if you want something that has a much broader styling featureset and much lighter bundle-size on web, you can use [Tamagui](https://tamagui.dev), which has no dependency on React Native.
