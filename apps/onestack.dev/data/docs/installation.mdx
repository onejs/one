Getting started with One is as as easy as:

```bash
npx one
```

The CLI will guide you through the process of bootstrapping one of our starter templates.

If this is your first One app, we recommend taking this route, as you can choose between bare-bones example all the way up to a full stack with a user system and authentication. We will be launching more starters as the project matures.

### 5-minute tutorial

While we recommend using a preset to get started, it's helpful to walk through creating a new One app from scratch.

For those of you who prefer to learn by doing, we've put together a 5-minute tutorial that will have you building a basic app in no time.

Let's begin with our package.json:

```json fileName=package.json
{
  "name": "one-app",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "one dev",
    "build": "one build",
    "serve": "one serve"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "one": "latest",
    "react": "19.1.0",
    "react-native": "0.81.4",
    "react-native-web": "^0.21.0",
    "@react-navigation/native": "~7.1.19",
    "react-native-safe-area-context": "^5.6.1",
    "react-native-screens": "~4.16.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "vite": "^7"
  }
}
```

It is strongly recommended to pin the `one` version for production stability:

```bash
# npm
npm install one@latest --save-exact

# yarn
yarn add one@latest --exact

# pnpm
pnpm add one@latest --save-exact

# bun
bun add one@latest --exact
```

This ensures consistent behavior across different environments and deployments.

If using pnpm or a package manager that symlinks dependencies, you'll want to disable that setting.
One has (just a few) patches that fix dependencies. This is because the React Native ecosystem has many weirdly published packages (think JSX or Flowtype published in `.js` files, or non-standard legacy babel experimental transforms, etc). We are working with package authors to improve this, but we've found patches to be more reliable, simpler and less mysterious than other solutions.

<Notice>
  **Platform Support**: One currently doesn't support Windows or Bun with the `--bun`
  runtime for development. We're happy to accept contributions that add support for these
  platforms. For now, please use macOS or Linux with Node.js or other supported package
  managers.
</Notice>

### Vite Config

Next, let's add our ultra-simple `vite.config.ts`:

```tsx fileName=vite.config.ts
import type { UserConfig } from 'vite'
import { one } from 'one/vite'

export default {
  plugins: [one()],
} satisfies UserConfig
```

### TSConfig

One will create a TSConfig for you when you first start the dev server, with some defaults that work well. Of course you can create your own if you'd prefer. The default looks like this:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "~/*": ["./*"]
    },
    "strict": true,
    "rootDir": ".",
    "module": "Preserve",
    "moduleResolution": "Bundler",
    "preserveSymlinks": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "noImplicitAny": false,
    "types": ["node", "react", "vite/client"],
    "lib": ["dom", "esnext"]
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules", ".expo", "**/test", "**/dist", "**/types", "**/__tests__"]
}
```

For TypeScript types on One's [preset environment variables](/docs/environment#preset-environment-variables), add `/// <reference types="one/env" />` to any `.d.ts` file in your project.

### File System Routes

One expects your file system routes to be placed in an `app` directory.

`app/_layout.tsx` serves as the top-level wrapper for all routes, ideal for:

1. Consistent page structure
2. Global styles or themes
3. Persistent navigation
4. App-wide state management

One uses the `<Slot />` component to indicate where child components should render, allowing for nested layouts and fine-grained control over your UI structure.

Let's create a root layout `app/_layout.tsx`:

```tsx fileName=app/_layout.tsx
import { Slot } from 'one'

export default function Layout() {
  return <Slot />
}
```

And then create a simple index page `app/index.tsx`:

```tsx fileName=app/index.tsx
import { View, Text } from 'react-native'

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <View
      style={{
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignItems: 'center',
        minHeight: '100%',
      }}
    >
      <Text>Hello from One</Text>
    </View>
  )
}
```

You can now install your node modules and run your app. 🎉

```bash
yarn install && yarn dev
```

### Running your app

If the port isn't taken, you should be able to load [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) and to see your website (use `--port` to change the port).

On native, you can use an [Expo Go](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779) development app and load your app with [exp://0.0.0.0:8081](exp://0.0.0.0.:8081). Press the key combination <kbd>q</kbd>, <kbd>r</kbd> in your terminal which is running the dev server, and scan the QR code with your iPhone's camera if your computer and iPhone are connected to the same WiFi network.

Note that for web-only projects you don't need `react-native`, and further note that if you want something that has a much broader styling featureset and much lighter bundle-size on web, you can use [Tamagui](https://tamagui.dev), which has no dependency on React Native.

### About Metro Mode

In the configuration above, we've enabled Metro mode by setting `bundler: 'metro'`. This is the recommended setting for production React Native apps as it provides:

- **Stability**: Metro is the battle-tested bundler used by React Native
- **Compatibility**: Works with all React Native packages without modification
- **Production-ready**: Used by thousands of production apps

While One's experimental Vite native bundler offers faster build times, Metro mode ensures maximum stability and compatibility. See the [Metro Mode documentation](/docs/metro-mode) for more details.
