title: useActiveParams
---

This will return the segments of the current URL paths, including dynamic path segments.

Note that this function, as opposed to [useParams](/docs/hooks-useParams), will update even when the path is not relevant to the route it is used inside. In general when you need to access params, use `useParams`, as these will only update when the route is focused.

This hook is useful for things like analytics where you need to access every change globally.

```tsx
import { useActiveParams } from 'one'

export default function AnalyticsTracker() {
  const params = useActiveParams()

  // Track every route change, even when not inside the matched route
  useEffect(() => {
    analytics.track('page_view', params)
  }, [params])

  return null
}
```
