title: href

A simple function allows for creating typed route strings. It's a type-level only check, at runtime it only validates that it is a string.

```tsx
import { href } from 'one'

const postPageLink = href(`/post/hello-world`) // will type error if invalid Href
```

This is useful for ensuring your links are valid routes in your application at compile time.
