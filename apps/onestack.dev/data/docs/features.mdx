title: Features
description: One is a complete solution to cross-platform development with React and React Native. We're experimenting with a features document to offer a high-level overview of One.

See the [Status document](/docs/status) for the status of features.

## Vite

The One Vite Plugin automates away much of the setup & boilerplate required for cross-platform React Native & web development.

Out of the box, the One Vite plugin does the following:

- Sets up a [file system router](/docs/routing) in the `./app` folder
- Generates [types for routes](/docs/routing#types) and updates them when routes change
- Enables [loaders](/docs/routing-loader) and tree shakes them out on client using [babel-dead-code-elimination](https://github.com/pcattori/babel-dead-code-elimination)
- Supports [loader HMR](/docs/routing-loader#hot-reload-for-file-dependencies) with `watchFile` for instant content updates during development
- Enables the [`deps` option](/docs/configuration#deps) that allows for easy node_module patching
- Uses React 19 for both native and web
- Adds [vite-tsconfig-paths](https://github.com/aleclarson/vite-tsconfig-paths) plugin, unless it detects you've added it already
- Loads `.env` file into `process.env` before running anything using [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
- Adds a well-configured `tsconfig.json` if it doesn't exist
- Enables [`?imagedata` imports](/docs/guides-images) for automatic image dimensions and blur placeholders
- Configures native to resolve "react-native" export field in package.json
- Configures platform-specific extensions `web|server|native|ios|android` for extensions `ts|tsx|js|mjs`, eg `.ios.ts`, `.server.ts`
- Adds a ssr-css plugin that enables perfect dev-mode CSS on first load, matching production
- Configures a wide variety of optimizeDeps presets for React Native library compatibility
- Patches a large number of known-bad node_modules to work with Vite
- Ensures optimized deps across all routes are found before first load, avoiding hard reloads and slow loads in development mode

## Universal

- Uses [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) routing and truly native layouts
- Adds [loaders](/docs/routing-loader) that work on native and web
- Adds [layout loaders](/docs/routing-layouts#layout-loaders) - layouts can export `loader()` just like pages
- Adds [`useMatches`](/docs/hooks-useMatches) hook to access all matched route data
- Adds [`useMatch`](/docs/hooks-useMatches#usematch) to find a specific route's loader data by route ID
- Adds [`usePageMatch`](/docs/hooks-useMatches#usepagematch) to get the current page's match
- Adds a [Link](/docs/components-Link) component for navigation
- Adds [`useSearchParams`](/docs/hooks-useSearchParams) for URLSearchParams API
- Adds a wide variety of hooks for routing
- Exports [SafeAreaView and useSafeAreaInsets](/docs/components-SafeAreaView) with an optimized web implementation
- Adds [`<Protected />`](/docs/components-Protected) component for declarative route guarding
- Adds [`useBlocker`](/docs/hooks-useBlocker) hook for blocking navigation with confirmation
- Adds [route validation](/docs/routing-loader#route-validation) with `validateParams` and `validateRoute`

## Native

- Implements a custom bundle output with React Native compatible commonjs
- Implements custom hot reloading that works with commonjs
- Implements a custom bridge to React Native for debug logging
- Implements logic to support importing assets, like images
- Tree-shakes server code from native bundles automatically
- Auto-detects and configures NativeWind support
- Auto-detects and configures Reanimated support
- Supports [Metro mode](/docs/metro-mode) for maximum compatibility
- [Stack Header Composition API](/docs/components-Stack#header-composition-api) for declarative native header configuration

## Web

- Adds `serve` command that sets up a [Hono](https://hono.dev/) server for production
- Implements SPA, SSG, and SSR style routing on a [per-page and global basis](/docs/render-modes)
- Server rendering - find JS and CSS for all nested routes and layouts and hoists it to header to avoid waterfalls and flickering
- Smart [link prefetching](/docs/configuration#weblinkprefetch) that predicts navigation using mouse trajectory
  - Doesn't require up-front route map so no scaling cost
- Automatically handles scroll restoration and [allows configuration](/docs/components-ScrollBehavior)
- Adds [scroll position groups](/docs/hooks-useScrollGroup) for independent scroll areas
- Adds [route masks](/docs/hooks-useRouter#route-masking) for displaying different URLs
- Adds an easy [`redirects` option](/docs/configuration)
- Adds [`generateStaticParams` export](/docs/routing-exports#generatestaticparams) for SSG and SSR routes
- Implements [API routes](/docs/render-modes#api)
- Adds a [page loading progress bar](/docs/components-LoadProgressBar)
- Swaps `query-string` and `url-parse` libraries to save ~20Kb
- Adds a [Redirect component](/docs/components-Redirect)
- Supports [middleware](/docs/routing-middlewares) for request interception and shared context
- [Deploy to Vercel or Cloudflare](/docs/guides-deployment) workers with a single config option
- Automatic [sitemap generation](/docs/configuration#sitemap) with per-route overrides
- [SPA shell rendering](/docs/configuration#webrenderrootlayout) - render the root layout into HTML for SPA pages so users see nav, head tags, and CSS immediately while page content loads client-side

## Devtools

- **[Dev Tools Panel](/docs/dev-tools)** - Press Alt+Space to open the spotlight menu with SEO Preview, Route Info, Loader Timing, and Errors panels
- **[Source Inspector](/docs/dev-tools#source-inspector)** - Hold Shift+Cmd (Mac) or Shift+Ctrl (Windows/Linux) and click any element to open in your editor

## Build

- [Parallel builds with worker threads](/docs/one-build#parallel-builds-with-worker-threads) for ~40% faster static page generation

## Extras

- Exports a variety of [helpful utility functions](/docs/helpers-utility-functions)
- Guide for [MDX support](/docs/guides-mdx)
- Guide for [light and dark mode](/docs/guides-dark-mode)
- Guide for [optimized images](/docs/guides-images) with `?imagedata` imports
