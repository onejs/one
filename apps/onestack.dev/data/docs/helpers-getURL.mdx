title: getURL
---

A function that takes no arguments and returns a string of the current URL of the running application on client or server.

```tsx
import { getURL } from 'one'

const url = getURL()
// Dev: "http://127.0.0.1:8081"
// Prod: Your ONE_SERVER_URL value
```

For example, in dev-mode by default this would be a string of `http://127.0.0.1:8081`. In non-development environments you will need to set `process.env.ONE_SERVER_URL` to your production URL with no trailing `/`.
