title: useParams
---

Returns an object that describes the route segments. This will only update for the route it's used inside of,
and avoids re-renders when, for example, a user navigates to another stack view that isn't matched.

This is the recommended way to access the URL parameters. If you need to access parameters across all routes, see [useActiveParams](/docs/hooks-useActiveParams).

```tsx
import { useParams } from 'one'

export default function PostPage() {
  // For a route like /post/[id].tsx
  const { id } = useParams()

  return <Text>Post ID: {id}</Text>
}
```
