description: Using Metro bundler for more stable native builds
---

## Overview

One supports using Metro as the bundler for native builds, providing a more stable and battle-tested bundling experience. While the default Vite bundler for native is experimental, Metro mode offers production-ready stability by leveraging React Native's standard bundler.

## Why Use Metro Mode?

- **Production Stability**: Metro is the official React Native bundler with years of production use
- **Better Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with all React Native packages and libraries
- **Familiar Tooling**: If you're coming from standard React Native development, Metro works as expected

## Enabling Metro Mode

There are two ways to enable Metro mode in your One app:

### 1. Vite Config (Recommended)

Configure Metro mode in your `vite.config.ts`:

```tsx fileName=vite.config.ts
import type { UserConfig } from 'vite'
import { one } from 'one/vite'

export default {
  plugins: [
    one({
      native: {
        // Enable Metro bundler for native builds
        bundler: 'metro',

        // Optional: Configure Metro-specific options
        bundlerOptions: {
          // Metro configuration options
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
} satisfies UserConfig
```

### 2. Environment Variable

You can also enable Metro mode using an environment variable:

```bash
ONE_METRO_MODE=1 npm run dev
```

This is useful for:

- Quick testing without changing configuration
- CI/CD pipeline overrides
- Development vs production bundler switching

## Configuration

When using Metro mode, you can pass Metro-specific configuration through the `bundlerOptions` field:

```tsx
one({
  native: {
    bundler: 'metro',
    bundlerOptions: {
      // Metro plugin options
      // Note: Options merging is not fully implemented yet
      // Search for "METRO-OPTIONS-MERGING" in the codebase for details
    },
  },
})
```

While Metro mode provides stability today, the One team is actively working on bringin Rolldown support to Vite mode and developing it to be production-ready.

For now, **Metro mode is the recommended choice for production React Native apps** using One.
