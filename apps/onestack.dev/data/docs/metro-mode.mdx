title: Metro Mode
description: Using Metro bundler for more stable native builds
---

## Overview

One supports using Metro as the bundler for native builds, providing a more stable and battle-tested bundling experience. While the default Vite bundler for native is experimental, Metro mode offers production-ready stability by leveraging React Native's standard bundler.

## Why Use Metro Mode?

- **Production Stability**: Metro is the official React Native bundler with years of production use
- **Better Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with all React Native packages and libraries
- **Familiar Tooling**: If you're coming from standard React Native development, Metro works as expected

<Notice theme="blue">
  While Metro mode provides stability today, the One team is actively working on bringing Rolldown support to Vite mode and developing it to be production-ready.
</Notice>

## Enabling Metro Mode

There are two ways to enable Metro mode in your One app:

### 1. Vite Config (Recommended)

Configure Metro mode in your `vite.config.ts`:

```tsx fileName=vite.config.ts
import type { UserConfig } from 'vite'
import { one } from 'one/vite'

export default {
  plugins: [
    one({
      native: {
        // Enable Metro bundler for native builds
        bundler: 'metro',

        // Optional: Configure Metro-specific options
        bundlerOptions: {
          // Metro configuration options
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
} satisfies UserConfig
```

### 2. Environment Variable

You can also enable Metro mode using an environment variable:

```bash
ONE_METRO_MODE=1 npm run dev
```

This is useful for:

- Quick testing without changing configuration
- CI/CD pipeline overrides
- Development vs production bundler switching

## Limitations

When using Metro mode, only some of the Vite features are supported. One provides only a subset of Vite functionality in Metro mode to maintain compatibility and stability.

<Notice theme="blue">
  Metro mode intentionally supports only a subset of Vite configurations and features. This approach helps avoid implementation differences between Vite and Metro that could cause compatibility issues with React Native packages.
  <br />
  We are actively working on expanding Vite feature support, but for any features we don't yet provide through Vite configuration, you can always use the standard React Native way to change the configuration using `babel.config.js` and `metro.config.js`.
</Notice>

Only the following Vite features and configurations are supported in Metro mode for now:

- [`import.meta.env` Built-in Constants](https://vite.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#built-in-constants) <Status is="mostly-stable" text="Partially Supported" />: supported but may not work as expected for web specific variables.
- [`import.meta.env` Env Variables](https://vite.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-variables) <Status is="stable" text="Supported" />
- `tsconfig-paths` <Status is="mostly-stable" text="Partially Supported" />: As one automatically configures [`vite-tsconfig-paths`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-tsconfig-paths) to support path mappings defined in `tsconfig.json` for your project, the same applies to Metro mode. However, if you are using the `vite-tsconfig-paths` plugin manually, the custom options you provide there will not be applied for Metro.

## Configuration

By default, the Metro bundler is configured with [Expo's defaults](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/config/metro/).

<Notice theme="green">
  We recommend using the standard Vite way for configuring if possible, as it provides a more consistent experience across web and native builds, and will be more future-proof to switch between bundlers.
</Notice>

Like ordinary React Native apps, you can still configure Metro using standard configuration files:

**`babel.config.js`** - Configure Babel transformations for your JavaScript/TypeScript code:

```js fileName=babel.config.js
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
  };
};
```

**`metro.config.js`** - Configure more advanced Metro bundler settings, such as resolver, transformations, or watcher options:

```js fileName=metro.config.js
const { getDefaultConfig } = require('expo/metro-config');

const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

module.exports = config;
```

These configuration files work exactly as they would in a standard React Native project, giving you full control over the bundling process.

## Performance

Metro mode is designed for production stability, but it may not match the performance of Vite as it is not optimized for speed, and is using Babel instead of SWC for transformations. However, we observed that Metro mode somehow provides better memory efficiency.
