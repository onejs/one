title: redirect
---

A function that takes two arguments: a string `path`, and an optional number `status`.

```tsx
import { redirect } from 'one'

export function redirectToLogin() {
  return redirect('/login')
}
```

It accepts relative paths by using the [`getURL`](/docs/helpers-getURL) helper internally.

On the server (including in loaders) it returns a `Response.redirect` object. On the client it calls `router.navigate` and returns void.

## Usage in Loaders

Use `redirect()` in loaders to protect routes. When a user navigates via `<Link>`, the loader runs on the server and the redirect is detected on the client before the protected page ever renders — no flash of unauthorized content, no data leaks.

```tsx fileName=app/dashboard+ssr.tsx
import { redirect, useLoader } from 'one'
import type { LoaderProps } from 'one'

export function loader({ request }: LoaderProps) {
  const session = getSession(request)

  if (!session) {
    throw redirect('/login')
  }

  return { user: session.user }
}

export default function Dashboard() {
  const { user } = useLoader(loader)
  return <Text>Welcome, {user.name}</Text>
}
```

Both `throw redirect()` and `return redirect()` work. `throw` is often cleaner since it stops execution immediately.

This works for both direct page loads (server returns a 302) and client-side `<Link>` navigation (server returns a redirect signal that the client intercepts before rendering).

### How It Works

During client-side navigation, loaders run on the server and the client fetches the result as a JavaScript module. When a loader returns `redirect()`:

1. The server detects the redirect response
2. Instead of returning a raw HTTP 302 (which the browser's module loader would silently follow), the server transforms it into a JS module containing redirect metadata
3. The client detects the redirect signal before navigating or rendering anything
4. The client navigates to the redirect target using `REPLACE` — the protected page never appears

This means **no sensitive data reaches the client** when a redirect occurs. The server only sends back the redirect path.
