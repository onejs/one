title: Status
description: One is currently in beta
---

This is a live document covering the high level status of the various parts of One. We don't cover all areas, just high level stable, and all developing or unstable sub-areas.

Broadly: web is generally stable, native is a bit further behind but is able to be daily driven in dev mode. We need to test and improve support of a wider variety of node_modules, and add documentation and tests.

---

#### Stages, from least to most stable

- <Status is="early" /> · <Status is="developing" /> · <Status is="mostly-stable" /> · <Status is="stable" />

### Web <Status is="mostly-stable" />

Web is mostly production ready, with a few smaller features still in development and wider testing and feedback needed.

- Production builds <Status is="stable" />
- Not Found <Status is="stable" />

### Native <Status is="developing" />

Native local development works fairly well, but needs broader testing. Production builds have landed
but have not been tested extensively.

- Local development <Status is="developing" />
- Production builds <Status is="developing" /> - Working but needs much wider testing.
- Assets <Status is="developing" />
- Symbolicator <Status is="early" />

### Routing <Status is="mostly-stable" />

SSG and SPA are mostly stable, SSR just landed and needs a decent amount of work to be stable.

- Performance <Status is="mostly-stable" /> - Needs to move to trie-based router, current loop-based.
- SSG <Status is="mostly-stable" />
- SPA <Status is="mostly-stable" />
- SSR <Status is="developing" />

- Tabs <Status is="stable" />
- Drawer <Status is="early" />

### Data <Status is="early" />

Zero is in public alpha. We have a starter available with `npx one` but Zero still needs to land a few more features before we recommend it for production.
