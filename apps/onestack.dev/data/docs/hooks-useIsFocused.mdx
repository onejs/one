Re-export of [useIsFocused from React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/use-is-focused/).

Returns a boolean, `true` if the current screen is active.

```tsx
import { useIsFocused } from 'one'

export default function ProfileScreen() {
  const isFocused = useIsFocused()

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{isFocused ? 'Screen is focused' : 'Screen is not focused'}</Text>
    </View>
  )
}
```

Note: If you need to run side effects when a screen becomes focused rather than just checking focus state, consider using [useFocusEffect](/docs/hooks-useFocusEffect) instead.
