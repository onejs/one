title: watchFile
---

A function that registers a file dependency for hot reload during development. When the file changes, the loader will automatically re-run and refresh data on the client without a full page reload.

```tsx fileName=app/blog/[slug].tsx
import { watchFile } from 'one'
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises'

export async function loader({ params: { slug } }) {
  const filePath = `./content/${slug}.mdx`
  watchFile(filePath)
  const content = await readFile(filePath, 'utf-8')
  return { content }
}
```

- No-op in production and on the client
- Pass the same path you use with `fs.readFile` or similar
- See [Loaders - Hot Reload](/docs/routing-loader#hot-reload-for-file-dependencies) for more details
