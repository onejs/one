<IntroParagraph>
  **One is a unified cross-platform React web and React Native framework that lives
  entirely in a Vite plugin**. One v1 is almost here - we've just released 1.0.0-rc.1,
  marking it ready for production use. With over 1,800 commits since the announcement of
  the alpha about a year ago, we're incredibly proud of the simple, robust framework it's
  become.
</IntroParagraph>

One makes building apps for both web and native a delight, bringing simplicity and sanity to what typically is an incredibly messy affair. Where before you'd need two frameworks, two bundlers, and a ton of glue code, with One it's now as simple as can be - Vite, a single plugin, and some file-system routes.

Get started a simply as:

```bash
npx one
```

Our goal for version one was to reach **stability**, deploy multiple apps into app stores, greatly reduce the risk of adoption, and to match the best web-only frameworks in features, ease-of-use and performance. We're cutting the RC today because we feel we're just about there.

A huge thanks is owed to [Pokai Chang](https://github.com/zetavg), who led the large part of the work of getting One to maturity, including large wins like Metro mode, and a robust web and native integration testing infrastructure.

One makes it possible for the first time to get **a 100 on your Lighthouse performance score without trouble**, even when sharing UI with native on fully on hydrated pages.

We think **One is great even if you are only targeting web**, in large part because our we only focus on React, and made the decision early to avoid implementing RSC for the sake of simplicity.

The major features in version 1 are:

- **[Fully-typed file system routes](/docs/routing-typed-routes)** with autogenerated helpers, groups, nested layouts, and `.platform` file-level forking.
- **[Fully typed links](/docs/routing-typed-routes)**, params, and more.
- Global and per-page **[render modes](/docs/render-modes)** with seamless routing between any of them - SSR, SSG, SPA - for flexibility and performance.
- **[Typed loaders](/docs/routing-loader)** for easy, simple, typed data loading and refetching.
- **Lock-in-free**: it's Vite + Hono, builds to a `dist` folder, and has multiple output targets.
- <New /> **[Metro-mode](/docs/metro-mode)**: use Metro for native, for maximum
  compatibility and ease of migration.
- <New /> **[Middleware](/docs/routing-middlewares)** for request interception and shared
  context.
- <New /> **[Sitemaps](/docs/configuration#sitemap)** with per-route overrides.
- <New /> **[Deploy to Vercel or Cloudflare](/docs/guides-deployment)** workers with a
  single config option.
- <New /> **[useLoaderState](/docs/hooks-useLoaderState)**, **[setServerData and
  getServerData](/docs/helpers-utility-functions)** for advanced data loading.
- <New /> **[setResponseHeaders](/docs/helpers-utility-functions#setresponseheaders)** for
  ISR/caching via CDN cache headers, cookies, and custom response headers.
- <New /> Automatic **[NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev)** and
  **[Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated)** detection and
  support.
- <New /> **[Advanced script loading
  strategies](/docs/configuration#webexperimental_scriptloading)** that significantly
  improve Lighthouse scores.
- <New /> **[Loader HMR](/docs/routing-loader#hot-reload-for-file-dependencies)** with
  `watchFile` for instant content updates during development.
- <New /> **[Image data imports](/docs/guides-images)** with `?imagedata` suffix for
  automatic dimensions and blur placeholders.
- <New /> **[Dev Tools](/docs/dev-tools)** - SEO preview, route debugging, loader timing,
  error tracking, and source inspector all in one unified panel (Alt+Space).
- <New /> **[useBlocker](/docs/hooks-useBlocker)** - Block navigation for unsaved forms
  with customizable confirmation prompts.
- <New /> **[Protected Routes](/docs/components-Protected)** - Declarative route guarding
  with automatic redirects for unauthenticated users.
- <New /> **[Route Validation](/docs/routing-loader#route-validation)** - Validate route
  params before navigation with Zod schemas or async functions.
- <New /> **CSS Collection Improvements** - In dev mode, route modules are pre-warmed to
  collect CSS upfront, avoiding flash of unstyled content during navigation.
- <New /> **[Route Masks](/docs/hooks-useRouter#route-masking)** - Display a different URL
  in the browser while navigating to complex routes, perfect for modals and side panels.
- <New /> **[Scroll Position Groups](/docs/hooks-useScrollGroup)** - Preserve scroll
  position when navigating between child routes in nested layouts.
- <New /> **[LCP Optimization and CSS inlining](/docs/configuration#webinlinelayoutcss)**
  - Inline layout CSS for a great hybrid mix of first-load performance and caching, and
  optimize LCP for 30+% improved Lighthouse scores.
- <New /> **[Smart Link Prefetching](/docs/configuration#weblinkprefetch)** - Predicts
  which link you're moving toward using mouse trajectory, prefetching before you hover.
- <New /> **[useSearchParams](/docs/hooks-useSearchParams)** - Standard URLSearchParams
  API for working with query strings.
- <New /> **[useMatches, useMatch, usePageMatch](/docs/hooks-useMatches)** - Access all
  matched routes and their loader data for breadcrumbs, layouts accessing page data, and
  more.
- <New /> **[Stack Header Composition API](/docs/components-Stack#header-composition-api)** -
  Declaratively configure native stack headers with `Stack.Header`, `Stack.Header.Title`,
  `Stack.Header.SearchBar`, and more.
- <New /> **[Parallel builds with worker threads](/docs/one-build#parallel-builds-with-worker-threads)** -
  Static page generation now uses multiple CPU cores by default for ~40% faster builds.
- <New /> **[SPA Shell Rendering](/docs/configuration#webrenderrootlayout)** - Render your
  root layout into the HTML shell for SPA pages, giving users immediate visual content
  (nav, head tags, CSS) while page content loads client-side. Supports per-route titles
  via `usePathname()` and static, SSR, or hybrid modes.

## Get Started

As easy as:

```bash
npx one
```

We have a few starters to choose from. From there, check out the [introduction](/docs/introduction), [routing guide](/docs/routing), or [deployment docs](/docs/guides-deployment).

## What about Rolldown?

We've been testing Rolldown in a branch and it's looking promising. It works mostly on web already and will make our lives easier on native, but we're waiting for their full-bundle dev mode as it will greatly simplify the transition. We expect web support to land shortly after.

## Community

One started as a fork of [Expo Router](https://expo.dev/router), which itself built on [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org). One is built top of our [vxrn](https://vxrn.dev) library. We owe a thanks to the Expo and React Navigation teams.
