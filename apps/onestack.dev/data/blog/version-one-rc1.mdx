<IntroParagraph>
  **One is a unified cross-platform React web and React Native framework that lives
  entirely in a Vite plugin**. One v1 is almost here - we've just released 1.0.0-rc.1,
  marking it ready for production use. With over 1,800 commits since the announcement of
  the alpha about a year ago we're incredibly proud of the simple, robust framework it's
  become.
</IntroParagraph>

One makes building apps for both web and native a delight, bringing simplicity and sanity to
what typically is an incredibly messy affair. Where before you'd need two frameworks, two bundlers, and a ton of glue code, with One it's now as simple as can be - Vite, a single plugin, and some file-system routes. **Achieving a 100 Lighthouse performance score while sharing code between web and native has turned from a pipe-dream into the expectation with One**.

**One is a great framework even if you are only targeting web**. In a world haunted by the complexity of RSC, One has always taken a simple-is-better stance, while still giving you best-in-class features:

- **[Typed file system routes](/docs/routing-typed-routes)** with `.platform` file-level forking.
- **Fully typed links**, params, and more with auto-generation.
- Global and per-page **[render modes](/docs/routing-modes)** - SSR, SSG, SPA - for flexibility and performance.
- **[Typed loaders](/docs/routing-loader)** for easy and simple data loading.
- **Lock-in-free**: build to a `dist` folder, built-in Hono production server.
- <New /> **[Metro-mode](/docs/metro-mode)**: use Metro for native, for maximum compatibility.
- <New /> **[Middleware](/docs/routing-middlewares)** for request interception and shared context.
- <New /> **[Sitemaps](/docs/configuration#sitemap)** with per-route overrides.
- <New /> **[Deploy to Vercel or Cloudflare](/docs/guides-deployment)** workers with a single config option.
- <New /> **[useLoaderState](/docs/hooks-useLoaderState)**, **[setServerData and getServerData](/docs/helpers-utility-functions)** for advanced data loading.
- <New /> Automatic **NativeWind** and **Reanimated** detection and support.
- <New /> **[Advanced loading strategies](/docs/configuration#web)** that significantly improve Lighthouse scores.

## Thanks

One wouldn't be possible without our core team:

- [Pokai Chang](https://github.com/pockiiie) and [Quan Nguyen](https://github.com/anhquan291) - for countless hours of contributions, bug fixes, and helping shape One into what it is today.

One builds on excellent open source work:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev)
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org)
- [Expo](https://expo.dev)
- [Hono](https://hono.dev)
- [Remix](https://remix.run)
- [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com) — react-native-screens, gesture-handler, reanimated

And thank you to folks who helped directly:

- [Fatih Aygün](https://github.com/cyco130)
- [Hiroshi Ogawa](https://github.com/hi-ogawa)
- [Matias Capeletto](https://github.com/patak-dev)
- Dan Maier (for the `one` package name)

One started as a fork of [Expo Router](https://expo.dev/router), built on top of [vxrn](https://vxrn.dev). It maintains nearly full API compatibility with Expo Router, while adding features One needs (typed routes, loaders on web + native, per-route render modes, middleware, and broader deployment targets).
