<IntroParagraph>
  **One is a unified cross-platform React web and React Native framework that lives
  entirely in a Vite plugin**. One v1 is almost here - we've just released 1.0.0-rc.1,
  marking it ready for production use. With over 1,800 commits since the announcement of
  the alpha about a year ago, we're incredibly proud of the simple, robust framework it's
  become.
</IntroParagraph>

One makes building apps for both web and native a delight, bringing simplicity and sanity to
what typically is an incredibly messy affair. Where before you'd need two frameworks, two bundlers, and a ton of glue code, with One it's now as simple as can be - Vite, a single plugin, and some file-system routes.

Thanks to a lot of investment, we've achieved something remarkable: **stability**, and **class-leading performance**. Not bad a for a side project!

Thanks to per-page render modes and a variety of optimizations, One makes it possible for the first time to **get 100 on your Lighthouse performance score, even on hydrated pages that share all code with native**.

One is **a uniquely great framework even if you are only targeting web**. In a world haunted by complexity, One punches above it's weight by _focusing_: it only supports React: not multiple frameworks, no RSC, no magic directives. With much development, it now has a featureset to rival any modern web framework.

Some highlights:

- **[Fully-typed file system routes](/docs/routing-typed-routes)** with autogenerated helpers, groups, nested layouts, and `.platform` file-level forking.
- **[Fully typed links](/docs/routing-typed-routes)**, params, and more.
- Global and per-page **[render modes](/docs/render-modes)** with seamless routing between any of them - SSR, SSG, SPA - for flexibility and performance.
- **[Typed loaders](/docs/routing-loader)** for easy, simple, typed data loading and refetching.
- **Lock-in-free**: it's Vite + Hono, builds to a `dist` folder, and has multiple output targets.
- <New /> **[Metro-mode](/docs/metro-mode)**: use Metro for native, for maximum
  compatibility and ease of migration.
- <New /> **[Middleware](/docs/routing-middlewares)** for request interception and shared
  context.
- <New /> **[Sitemaps](/docs/configuration#sitemap)** with per-route overrides.
- <New /> **[Deploy to Vercel or Cloudflare](/docs/guides-deployment)** workers with a
  single config option.
- <New /> **[useLoaderState](/docs/hooks-useLoaderState)**, **[setServerData and
  getServerData](/docs/helpers-utility-functions)** for advanced data loading.
- <New /> **[setResponseHeaders](/docs/helpers-utility-functions#setresponseheaders)** for
  ISR/caching via CDN cache headers, cookies, and custom response headers.
- <New /> Automatic **[NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev)** and **[Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated)** detection and support.
- <New /> **[Advanced script loading strategies](/docs/configuration#webexperimental_scriptloading)** that
  significantly improve Lighthouse scores.
- <New /> **[Loader HMR](/docs/routing-loader#hot-reload-for-file-dependencies)** with
  `watchFile` for instant content updates during development.
- <New /> **[Image data imports](/docs/guides-images)** with `?imagedata` suffix for
  automatic dimensions and blur placeholders.
- <New /> **[Dev Tools](/docs/dev-tools)** - SEO preview, route debugging, loader timing,
  error tracking, and source inspector all in one unified panel (Alt+Space).
- <New /> **[useBlocker](/docs/hooks-useBlocker)** - Block navigation for unsaved forms
  with customizable confirmation prompts.
- <New /> **[Protected Routes](/docs/components-Protected)** - Declarative route guarding
  with automatic redirects for unauthenticated users.
- <New /> **[Route Validation](/docs/routing-loader#route-validation)** - Validate route
  params before navigation with Zod schemas or async functions.
- <New /> **CSS Collection Improvements** - In dev mode, route modules are pre-warmed to
  collect CSS upfront, avoiding flash of unstyled content during navigation.
- <New /> **[Route Masks](/docs/hooks-useRouter#route-masking)** - Display a different URL
  in the browser while navigating to complex routes, perfect for modals and side panels.
- <New /> **[Scroll Position Groups](/docs/hooks-useScrollGroup)** - Preserve scroll
  position when navigating between child routes in nested layouts.
- <New /> **[LCP Optimization and CSS inlining](/docs/configuration#webinlinelayoutcss)** - Inline layout CSS for a great hybrid mix
  of first-load performance and caching, and optimize LCP for 30+% improved Lighthouse
  scores.
- <New /> **[Smart Link Prefetching](/docs/configuration#weblinkprefetch)** - Predicts
  which link you're moving toward using mouse trajectory, prefetching before you hover.
- <New /> **[useSearchParams](/docs/hooks-useSearchParams)** - Standard URLSearchParams
  API for working with query strings, matching expo-router.
- <New /> **[useMatches, useMatch, usePageMatch](/docs/hooks-useMatches)** - Access all
  matched routes and their loader data for breadcrumbs, layouts accessing page data, and
  more.

## Getting Started

The quickest way:

```bash
npx one
```

Pick a starter and you're up and running. From there, check out the [introduction](/docs/introduction), [routing guide](/docs/routing), or [deployment docs](/docs/guides-deployment).

## Thanks

One started as a fork of [Expo Router](https://expo.dev/router), itself a wrapper of [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org), built on top of [vxrn](https://vxrn.dev). Thanks to the Expo team and React Navigation team for their amazing OSS work.

A huge thanks is owed to [Pokai Chang](https://github.com/zetavg), who led the majority of the work of maturing One to version 1. He landed Metro mode, countless bug fixes, a robust testing infrastructure, and much more.

One builds on some excellent open source work:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev)
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org)
- [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/)

## What about Rolldown?

We've been testing Rolldown in a branch and it's looking promising. It works mostly on web already and will make our lives easier on native, but we're waiting for their full-bundle dev mode as it will greatly simplify the transition. We expect web support to land shortly after.
