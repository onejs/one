  One v1 RC is here. It represents ~1,800 commits from a small team, plus a lot of
  community help. This post explains what One is and what changed since the v1
  announcement.

[TODO]


## Getting started

Add One to your Vite config:

```tsx
import { one } from 'one/vite'

export default {
  plugins: [one()],
}
```

Then run:

```bash
npx one
```

Pick a starter and go.

## What you get from the plugin

- **File-system routing** in `./app` for web + native
- **Render modes** (SSG, SSR, SPA, API) per-route or globally
- **Loaders** that run on the server and tree-shake out of the client
- **React Native support** via Metro (recommended today), with ongoing work on Vite-native builds
- **Middleware** for request interception and shared context
- **A production server** built on [Hono](https://hono.dev)

The goal is straightforward configuration: one plugin, one routing model, one data-loading model.

## Routing

Routes map directly from files:

```
app/
  index.tsx              → /
  about.tsx              → /about
  blog/[slug].tsx        → /blog/:slug
  settings/_layout.tsx   → wraps /settings/*
```

On web you get URLs; on native you get screens (React Navigation). Same files.

### Render modes (per route)

Use filename suffixes to choose how a route runs:

```
app/
  index+ssg.tsx          # static HTML at build time
  dashboard+spa.tsx      # client-only, no SSR
  posts/[id]+ssr.tsx     # server render on each request
  api/users+api.tsx      # JSON endpoint
```

Or set a default:

```tsx
one({ web: { defaultRenderMode: 'spa' } })
```

(SSG is the default right now because it’s a solid baseline for most pages.)

### Typed routes

One generates route types and provides a helper that keeps params + loaders typed:

```tsx
import { createRoute } from 'one'

const route = createRoute<'/blog/[slug]'>()

export const loader = route.createLoader(async ({ params }) => {
  const post = await db.posts.find(params.slug)
  return { post }
})

export default function Post() {
  const { slug } = route.useParams()
  const { post } = useLoader(loader)
  return <article>{post.content}</article>
}
```

This generates a `routes.d.ts` so your editor knows what exists.

### Platform-specific routes

If you need different implementations:

```
app/
  settings.tsx
  settings.web.tsx
  settings.native.tsx
  settings.ios.tsx
```

## Data loading

### Loaders

A loader runs on the server (SSG/SSR) and its result is available to your component:

```tsx
export const loader = async ({ params, request }) => {
  const post = await db.posts.find(params.slug)
  return { post }
}

export default function Post() {
  const { post } = useLoader(loader)
  return <article>{post.content}</article>
}
```

Loader code is **tree-shaken out of the client**.

We took inspiration from [Remix](https://remix.run)’s loader ergonomics and focused on making the same approach work on native too.

### useLoaderState (loading + refetch)

```tsx
function Post() {
  const { data, refetch, state } = useLoaderState(loader)

  return (
    <div>
      {state === 'loading' && <Spinner />}
      <button onClick={refetch}>Refresh</button>
      <article>{data.post.content}</article>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Server-to-client data

For cases where you want to attach extra server data:

```tsx
import { setServerData } from 'one'

export const loader = async () => {
  setServerData('user', { name: 'Nate', role: 'admin' })
  return { posts: await db.posts.all() }
}
```

```tsx
import { getServerData } from 'one'

const user = getServerData('user')
```

## Middleware

Add `_middleware.ts` in any folder:

```tsx
import { createMiddleware } from 'one'

export default createMiddleware(async ({ request, next, context }) => {
  const user = await getUser(request)
  if (!user) return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 })

  context.user = user
  return next()
})
```

Middleware runs top-to-bottom for routes beneath it, can intercept requests, and can pass data through `context`.

## Native (today)

One supports React Native and aims to keep the workflow familiar.

### Metro mode (recommended)

```tsx
one({ native: { bundler: 'metro' } })
```

Metro is the stable choice today. It supports:

- Fast Refresh / HMR
- React Native DevTools
- `import.meta.env` (Vite-like env behavior)
- React Compiler support
- production bundle builds

### Prebuild

```bash
npx one prebuild
```

Options:

```bash
npx one prebuild --expo false
npx one prebuild --platform ios
npx one prebuild --no-install
```

### NativeWind

If NativeWind is installed, One detects it and configures compilation automatically.

## Web performance knobs (optional)

These are optional switches—use them if they help your app.

### Route preloading

Routes preload before navigation completes to reduce flicker and surprise loading boundaries. CSS is also preloaded and injected during client-side navigation.

### Script loading

```tsx
one({
  web: {
    experimental_scriptLoading: 'after-lcp',
  },
})
```

- `defer-non-critical`
- `after-lcp`
- `after-lcp-aggressive`

### Inline layout CSS

```tsx
one({
  web: {
    inlineLayoutCSS: true,
  },
})
```

## Deployment

### Node (default)

```bash
npx one build
npx one serve
```

This runs a [Hono](https://hono.dev) server. Deploy anywhere Node runs.

### Vercel

```tsx
one({ web: { deploy: 'vercel' } })
```

```bash
npx one build
vercel deploy --prebuilt
```

Uses Vercel Build Output API v3 directly: SSR routes become serverless functions; static routes deploy statically.

### Cloudflare Workers

```tsx
one({ web: { deploy: 'cloudflare' } })
```

```bash
npx one build
cd dist && wrangler deploy
```

Routes lazy-load to keep cold starts reasonable.

### Sitemap generation

```tsx
one({
  web: {
    sitemap: {
      baseUrl: 'https://example.com',
      priority: 0.7,
      changefreq: 'weekly',
      exclude: ['/admin/*', '/api/*'],
    },
  },
})
```

Routes can export:

```tsx
export const sitemap = { priority: 0.9, changefreq: 'daily' }
```

## Developer experience

### Dev server shortcuts

```
ow  → open web
oi  → open iOS simulator
oa  → open Android emulator
qr  → show QR for Expo Go
dt  → open React Native DevTools
```

### Debug routing

Set `ONE_DEBUG_ROUTER=1` to get detailed logs (route tree, navigation, middleware chains, matches).

### Error boundaries by default

Routes get an error boundary automatically so you see actionable errors instead of a blank screen.

### Scroll behavior

```tsx
import { ScrollBehavior } from 'one';

<ScrollBehavior />
```

Handles scroll position + basic hash routing (renamed from `ScrollRestoration`).

## What’s new since the v1 announcement

If you looked at One earlier and bounced, these are the major additions and fixes since the initial announcement.

### Data loading

- `useLoaderState` (loading state + refetch)
- `setServerData` / `getServerData`
- loaders receive `request`
- loaders receive `search` params
- typed loaders via `route.createLoader()`

### Routing

- typed routes via `createRoute`
- middleware via `createMiddleware`
- platform route extensions (`.web`, `.native`, `.ios`)
- sitemap generation
- error boundaries on every route
- hash routing support via `ScrollBehavior`
- `ignoredRouteFiles` config
- improved sorting for dynamic segments + layout nesting
- fixes for layout hook values during first render

### Native

- React Native 0.81 + Expo 54
- Metro mode with HMR + DevTools + production builds
- NativeWind auto-detection
- prebuild without Expo (`--expo false`)
- `--platform` flag for iOS/Android-only generation

### Web

- Vercel deployment support (Build Output API v3)
- Cloudflare Workers deploy mode with lazy route loading
- URL rewrites via `web.rewrites`

### Performance / build

- route preloading to reduce flicker
- `experimental_scriptLoading`
- `inlineLayoutCSS`
- parallel server + client builds
- CSS preloading during client-side navigation

### Core / stability work

- server context migrated away from globals (more reliable on serverless)
- improved route info context (hooks more accurate on first render)
- fixes for rapid navigation edge cases
- loader cache-busting to avoid stale deploys
- better process handling (clean shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM)
- smarter dependency scanning (fewer hard reloads)
- HMR fixes for platform extensions and file type edge cases

## Breaking changes / migration notes

A few things moved around:

| Old                            | New                            |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| ScrollRestoration              | ScrollBehavior                 |
| ssr.disableAutoDepsPreBundling | ssr.autoDepsOptimization       |
| one.server.platform            | one.web.deploy                 |
| useFocusEffect(callback)       | useFocusEffect(callback, deps) |

Removed:

- `afterBuild`, `server.beforeStart` hooks (use Vite plugins instead)
- `one/server` export (import from `one` directly)

React Navigation is now a peer dependency:

```bash
npm install @react-navigation/native react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
```

## Where we’d love contributions

If you want to help, areas that make a big difference:

- docs (especially “first app”, deployment guides, native troubleshooting)
- example apps that show real patterns (auth, forms, caching, offline)
- issue triage + minimal repros (Vite/Metro edge cases)
- platform-specific polish (iOS/Android differences, navigation quirks)

If you’re unsure where to start, jump into Discord and we’ll point to a good first issue.

## Thanks

One builds on a lot of excellent open source work:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev)
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org)
- [Expo](https://expo.dev)
- [Hono](https://hono.dev)
- [Remix](https://remix.run)
- [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com) — react-native-screens, gesture-handler, reanimated

And thank you to folks who helped directly:

- [Fatih Aygün](https://github.com/cyco130)
- [Hiroshi Ogawa](https://github.com/hi-ogawa)
- [Matias Capeletto](https://github.com/patak-dev)
- Dan Maier (for the `one` package name)

One started as a fork of [Expo Router](https://expo.dev/router), built on top of [vxrn](https://vxrn.dev).
It maintains nearly full API compatibility with Expo Router, while adding features One needs (typed routes, loaders on web + native, per-route render modes, middleware, and broader deployment targets).
