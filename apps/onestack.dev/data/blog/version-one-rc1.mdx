<IntroParagraph>
  One is a new React framework that lives in a single Vite plugin. By simply adding it to
  your Vite config, you suddenly can target both web and native at once, with shared
  routing, tons of great features, and a free production server.
</IntroParagraph>

Version one of One is nearly here. Since we [announced One in September 2024 at ViteConf](https://youtu.be/HWeUin_9asM),
we've landed nearly 2,000 commits from 37 contributors. Over the last year our team built several large websites and apps with One, one now in both app stores. We're happy to announce that **we feel confident it's ready for production today**.

**One is a great framework even if you are only targeting web**, in a world haunted by the complexity of RSC, One has always
taken a simple-is-better stance, while still giving you best-in-class features:

- **[Typed file system routes](/docs/routing-typed-routes)** with `.platform` file-level forking.
- **Fully typed links**, params, and more with auto-generation.
- Global and per-page **[render modes](/docs/routing-modes)** - SSR, SSG, SPA - for flexibility and performance.
- **[Typed loaders](/docs/routing-loader)** for easy and simple data loading.
- **Lock-in-free**: build to a `dist` folder, built-in Hono production server.
- <New /> **[Metro-mode](/docs/metro-mode)**: use Metro for native, for maximum
  compatibility.
- <New /> **[Middleware](/docs/routing-middlewares)** for request interception and shared
  context.
- <New /> **[Sitemaps](/docs/configuration#sitemap)** with per-route overrides.
- <New /> **[Deploy to Vercel or Cloudflare](/docs/guides-deployment)** workers with a
  single config option.
- <New /> **[useLoaderState](/docs/hooks-useLoaderState)**, **[setServerData and
  getServerData](/docs/helpers-utility-functions)** for advanced data loading.
- <New /> Automatic **NativeWind** and **Reanimated** detection and support.
- <New /> **[Advanced loading strategies](/docs/configuration#web)** that significantly
  improve Lighthouse scores.

## Getting started

Add One to your Vite config:

```tsx
import { one } from 'one/vite'

export default {
  plugins: [one()],
}
```

Then run:

```bash
npx one
```

Pick a starter and go.

## What you get from the plugin

- **File-system routing** in `./app` for web + native
- **Render modes** (SSG, SSR, SPA, API) per-route or globally
- **Loaders** that run on the server and tree-shake out of the client
- **React Native support** via Metro (recommended today), with ongoing work on Vite-native builds
- **Middleware** for request interception and shared context
- **A production server** built on [Hono](https://hono.dev)

The goal is straightforward configuration: one plugin, one routing model, one data-loading model.

## Routing

Routes map directly from files:

```
app/
  index.tsx              → /
  about.tsx              → /about
  blog/[slug].tsx        → /blog/:slug
  settings/_layout.tsx   → wraps /settings/*
```

On web you get URLs; on native you get screens (React Navigation). Same files.

### Render modes (per route)

Use filename suffixes to choose how a route runs:

```
app/
  index+ssg.tsx          # static HTML at build time
  dashboard+spa.tsx      # client-only, no SSR
  posts/[id]+ssr.tsx     # server render on each request
  api/users+api.tsx      # JSON endpoint
```

Or set a default:

```tsx
one({ web: { defaultRenderMode: 'spa' } })
```

(SSG is the default right now because it’s a solid baseline for most pages.)

### Typed routes

One generates route types and provides a helper that keeps params + loaders typed:

```tsx
import { createRoute } from 'one'

const route = createRoute<'/blog/[slug]'>()

export const loader = route.createLoader(async ({ params }) => {
  const post = await db.posts.find(params.slug)
  return { post }
})

export default function Post() {
  const { slug } = route.useParams()
  const { post } = useLoader(loader)
  return <article>{post.content}</article>
}
```

This generates a `routes.d.ts` so your editor knows what exists.

### Platform-specific routes

If you need different implementations:

```
app/
  settings.tsx
  settings.web.tsx
  settings.native.tsx
  settings.ios.tsx
```

## Data loading

### Loaders

A loader runs on the server (SSG/SSR) and its result is available to your component:

```tsx
export const loader = async ({ params, request }) => {
  const post = await db.posts.find(params.slug)
  return { post }
}

export default function Post() {
  const { post } = useLoader(loader)
  return <article>{post.content}</article>
}
```

Loader code is **tree-shaken out of the client**.

We took inspiration from [Remix](https://remix.run)’s loader ergonomics and focused on making the same approach work on native too.

### useLoaderState (loading + refetch)

```tsx
function Post() {
  const { data, refetch, state } = useLoaderState(loader)

  return (
    <div>
      {state === 'loading' && <Spinner />}
      <button onClick={refetch}>Refresh</button>
      <article>{data.post.content}</article>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Middleware

Add `_middleware.ts` in any folder:

```tsx
import { createMiddleware } from 'one'

export default createMiddleware(async ({ request, next, context }) => {
  const user = await getUser(request)
  if (!user) return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 })

  context.user = user
  return next()
})
```

Middleware runs top-to-bottom for routes beneath it, can intercept requests, and can pass data through `context`.

## Native (today)

One supports React Native and aims to keep the workflow familiar.

### Metro mode (recommended)

```tsx
one({ native: { bundler: 'metro' } })
```

Metro is the stable choice today. It supports:

- Fast Refresh / HMR
- React Native DevTools
- `import.meta.env` (Vite-like env behavior)
- React Compiler support
- production bundle builds

### Prebuild

```bash
npx one prebuild
```

Options:

```bash
npx one prebuild --expo false
npx one prebuild --platform ios
npx one prebuild --no-install
```

### NativeWind

If NativeWind is installed, One detects it and configures compilation automatically.

## Web performance knobs (optional)

These are optional switches—use them if they help your app.

### Route preloading

Routes preload before navigation completes to reduce flicker and surprise loading boundaries. CSS is also preloaded and injected during client-side navigation.

### Script loading

```tsx
one({
  web: {
    experimental_scriptLoading: 'after-lcp',
  },
})
```

- `defer-non-critical`
- `after-lcp`
- `after-lcp-aggressive`

### Inline layout CSS

```tsx
one({
  web: {
    inlineLayoutCSS: true,
  },
})
```

## Deployment

### Node (default)

```bash
npx one build
npx one serve
```

This runs a [Hono](https://hono.dev) server. Deploy anywhere Node runs.

### Vercel

```tsx
one({ web: { deploy: 'vercel' } })
```

```bash
npx one build
vercel deploy --prebuilt
```

Uses Vercel Build Output API v3 directly: SSR routes become serverless functions; static routes deploy statically.

### Cloudflare Workers

```tsx
one({ web: { deploy: 'cloudflare' } })
```

```bash
npx one build
cd dist && wrangler deploy
```

Routes lazy-load to keep cold starts reasonable.

### Sitemap generation

```tsx
one({
  web: {
    sitemap: {
      baseUrl: 'https://example.com',
      priority: 0.7,
      changefreq: 'weekly',
      exclude: ['/admin/*', '/api/*'],
    },
  },
})
```

Routes can export:

```tsx
export const sitemap = { priority: 0.9, changefreq: 'daily' }
```

## Developer experience

### Dev server shortcuts

```
ow  → open web
oi  → open iOS simulator
oa  → open Android emulator
qr  → show QR for Expo Go
dt  → open React Native DevTools
```

### Debug routing

Set `ONE_DEBUG_ROUTER=1` to get detailed logs (route tree, navigation, middleware chains, matches).

### Error boundaries by default

Routes get an error boundary automatically so you see actionable errors instead of a blank screen.

### Scroll behavior

```tsx
import { ScrollBehavior } from 'one'
;<ScrollBehavior />
```

Handles scroll position + basic hash routing (renamed from `ScrollRestoration`).

## What’s new since the v1 announcement

If you looked at One earlier and bounced, these are the major additions and fixes since the initial announcement.

### Data loading

- `useLoaderState` (loading state + refetch)
- `setServerData` / `getServerData`
- loaders receive `request`
- loaders receive `search` params
- typed loaders via `route.createLoader()`

### Routing

- typed routes via `createRoute`
- middleware via `createMiddleware`
- platform route extensions (`.web`, `.native`, `.ios`)
- sitemap generation
- error boundaries on every route
- hash routing support via `ScrollBehavior`
- `ignoredRouteFiles` config
- improved sorting for dynamic segments + layout nesting
- fixes for layout hook values during first render

### Native

- React Native 0.81 + Expo 54
- Metro mode with HMR + DevTools + production builds
- NativeWind auto-detection
- prebuild without Expo (`--expo false`)
- `--platform` flag for iOS/Android-only generation

### Web

- Vercel deployment support (Build Output API v3)
- Cloudflare Workers deploy mode with lazy route loading
- URL rewrites via `web.rewrites`

## Thanks

One builds on a lot of excellent open source work:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev)
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org)
- [Expo](https://expo.dev)
- [Hono](https://hono.dev)
- [Remix](https://remix.run)
- [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com) — react-native-screens, gesture-handler, reanimated

And thank you to folks who helped directly:

- [Fatih Aygün](https://github.com/cyco130)
- [Hiroshi Ogawa](https://github.com/hi-ogawa)
- [Matias Capeletto](https://github.com/patak-dev)
- Dan Maier (for the `one` package name)

One started as a fork of [Expo Router](https://expo.dev/router), built on top of [vxrn](https://vxrn.dev).
It maintains nearly full API compatibility with Expo Router, while adding features One needs (typed routes, loaders on web + native, per-route render modes, middleware, and broader deployment targets).
